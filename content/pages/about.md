I'm studying [computer science at Brigham Young University](https://cs.byu.edu/). I'm interested in deep learning, and especially applying it to environmental challenges.

I grew up near Oakland, CA and have since moved to Provo, UT for school. I love it here!

When I'm not coding, you might find me running outside, planning a trip, reading about politics, or studying investing.
